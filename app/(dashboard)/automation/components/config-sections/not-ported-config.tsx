 * Stand-in for a config section that was not ported into this demo.
 *
 * The real app has 51 of these. Most are bound to a live platform API (Meta ad
 * accounts, TikTok identities, Google Sheets and Drive pickers, Frame.io, Notion),
 * so reproducing them without credentials would mean faking a dozen integrations
 * for no benefit to the task in TASK.md.
 *
 * They are stubbed rather than deleted so `config-panel.tsx` keeps the exact
 * routing shape it has in production: every trigger and action the registry can
 * produce still resolves to a section, and the panel's switch is unchanged.
